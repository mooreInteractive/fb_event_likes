fb_event_likes
==============

source.js shows the javascript as I wrote it.
bookmarklet.js is not actually JS, but an anonymous function prefixed with 'Javascript:' so you can just copy and paste it into your bookmark manager.

TO USE: This should work on any Facebook event page. Go to the page and run this bookmarklet. 

The script will first continuously scroll the page to get all posts. Then it will parse the number of likes on each post and reorder them. They are then displayed on the page with the rest of the Facebook HTML sctripped out. Each post has a Ranking, and number of likes banner attached to the top of it.
